For my node project, I want to build a full-stack single page application based around the NFL. 
It would perform a few different tasks. Firstly, it would display the NFL schedule for each week. Secondly, it would
allow the user to predict winners for as many games as they would like. Thirdly, and this is probably going to be a
stretch challenge for me, but it would allow each user to pick winners to challenge the 'CPU'.
